# Credit-Card-Fraud-Detection-using-ML-and-DL

As we are moving towards the digital world, cyber security is becoming a crucial part of our life. When we talk about security in digital life then the main challenge is to find the abnormal activity.  
One of such examples is Credit card Frauds which is, when we make any transaction using credit cards there will be chance of misusing it by the cyber attackers.
To avoid this type of fraud attacks, this project aimed to build machine learning models and deep learning models which can identify the fraud transaction in the given transactions.
